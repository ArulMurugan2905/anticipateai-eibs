# AnticipateAI – EIBS 2.0

AnticipateAI is a blockchain-based anticipatory disaster relief system designed to release emergency funds *before* disasters strike, using climate and weather risk triggers.

## Problem
Disaster relief today is reactive, slow, and prone to fund leakage. Aid often reaches affected communities only after severe damage has occurred.

## Solution
AnticipateAI uses:
- Climate and weather risk signals
- Smart contracts for automated fund release
- Stablecoin-based direct transfers to verified beneficiaries
- Merchant-restricted spending for essential needs
- On-chain transparency for donors and NGOs

## Planned Blockchain Architecture
- Smart Contracts: Solidity
- Network: Polygon / EVM-compatible chain
- Stablecoin: USDC / equivalent
- Oracle: Chainlink (weather & climate data)
- Wallets: Beneficiary & merchant wallets
- Transparency: Public on-chain audit trail

## Current Status
This repository represents the **initial architecture and design stage** submitted for Round 1 of East India Blockchain Summit (EIBS) 2.0.
Smart contracts and prototype will be implemented in the Grand Finale round.
