# AnticipateAI – System Architecture

## Overview
AnticipateAI is an anticipatory disaster relief system that releases funds before disasters occur using forecast-based triggers.

## Components
- Stablecoin Treasury: Pool funded by NGOs and donors
- Oracle Layer: Weather and climate risk data (e.g., Chainlink)
- Smart Contracts: Automated fund release logic
- Beneficiary Wallets: Verified recipients in high-risk zones
- Merchant Wallets: Approved vendors for essential goods
- Audit Dashboard: Public on-chain transparency

## Workflow
1. Climate risk data is monitored continuously
2. Risk threshold crossed
3. Smart contract auto-triggers
4. Stablecoins released to beneficiaries
5. Spending restricted to essentials
6. Transactions recorded on-chain
